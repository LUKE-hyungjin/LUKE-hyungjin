## 🚀 About Me

> **"Combining mechanical intuition with AI data analytics."**

I am an **Industrial AI Engineer** who understands **Mechanical Systems** and optimizes them using **Data & AI technologies**.

With a strong foundation in Mechanical Engineering, I deeply understand hardware principles. Through my service as a Software Engineer in the Air Force and my academic research, I have honed the skills to digitize physical systems. Beyond simple coding, I focus on solving critical industrial challenges such as **Predictive Maintenance, Process Optimization, and Design Automation** using Machine Learning.

My goal is to translate "physical problems" from the field into "data language" to create tangible value.
